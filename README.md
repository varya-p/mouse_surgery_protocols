# Mouse surgery protocols
## Procedure for mouse headplate implant surgery

### Mouse preparation
1. If mouse is water-restricted, give mouse 5 mL of water for 2 days prior to injection
NB: Viral transduction is poor in water restricted mice
2. Dexamethasone (anti-inflammatory) injection: IP 0.5 mL of 0.25 mg/mL, ideally a few hours before surgery (but can be just before surgery)
3. Saline injection: IP 0.5 mL saline (total of 1 mL for dehydration), immediately before surgery

### Surgery rig setup
1. Turn on heating pad (37ºC) 
2. Cover hearing pad with diaper + paper towel
3. Place diaper to the side for surgical tools
4. Sterilize surgical tools with 70% ethanol
5. Clean headplate with razor, rinse with tap water, sterilize with 70% ethanol
6. Spray mouthpiece and earbars with quatricide
7. Zero the stereotax:
With objective mounted, adjust vertical beam until centered on crosshairs. Zero the coordinates
8. Calibrate pressure sensor.
9. Prepare 3 test tubes: betadine, ethanol, and sterile saline (PBS)
10. Fill isoflurane chamber (until bottom of the top triangle on gauge)

### Fix Mouse on Stereotax
1. Place mouse in anesthesia chamber and induce anesthesia with 3% isoflurane @ 1.5 mL/min
2. Switch valves to stereotax, decrease isoflurane to 2%. Transfer mouse to stereotax
3. Place front teeth in hole in stereotax bite bar. Press down. Slide in nozzle
4. Insert ear bars and adjust to the same length on both sides
5. Add petroleum jelly ointment to eyes

### Prep injection area
1. Remove hair
  1. Cut hair with razor or scissors
  2. Add Nair and rub in with q-tip without pressing too hard. Wait 1-2 min.
  3. Remove Nair with q-tip and wash off with alcohol pad
2. Sterilize area
  1. Add iodine with q-tip, rubbing in outward spiraling motion
  2. Add ethanol with q-tip
  3. Repeat for total of 3 times
  4. Clean up with alcohol pad
3. Cut hole in the skin under the scope
  * Use scissors to tent up skin and cut
4. Rupture shiny membrane under the skin with two q-tips
5. Dry off skull with compressed air duster and q-tips

### Align head 
1. Zero bregma to the stereotax
2. With objective mounted, move head until bregma is at center.
3. Adjust yaw, pitch, roll using pressure sensors
  * Roll: rotate top knob until pressure sensors are even on both sides
  * Pitch: Set on side of pressure sensor to 20 and zero. Turn pressure censure 90 degrees to check
  * Yaw: Zero at bregma, then move pointer back to lambda to make sure it’s still centered

### Cement headplate
1. Etch the skull in a crosshatch pattern
2. Fill bucket with ice and get ceramic bowl
3. Mix metabond using a snapped q-tip
  1. Mix 2 scoops of powder and 5 drops of quickbase
  2. Add drop of catalyst and mix
4. Add metabond to exposed skull using a snapped q-tip
5. Apply metabond to the headplate and place parallel to the eyes
6. Secure the headplate with metabond on the inside and on the outside anterior and posterior
7. Wait 5 min for metabond to harden
8. Sharpie mouse ID on metabond

### Cleanup
1. Remove ears bars and place mouse in recovery chamber with heat pad on one half. Monitor for ~1 hour
2, Turn off heating pad, air flow, ISO and lights
3. Sterilize tools in Benzall
4. Zero stereotax
5. Fill out surgery report
